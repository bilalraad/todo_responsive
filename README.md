# Todo Responsive

This project is just to test flutter for web and learn how to make a responsive UI

You can try it at the link here:

The design was inspired from this [source](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/to-do-task-list-dark-app-version), I took it and made a web version of it and changed/added some stuff. Also I made a white version of it.
